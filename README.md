Jarvis is a smart Python-based voice assistant that performs daily tasks using speech recognition and text-to-speech technology. It can open websites, search Wikipedia, send WhatsApp messages to multiple contacts, provide real-time weather updates (without any API key), and control basic system operations like shutdown and restart.
This project is built using Python and popular libraries such as pyttsx3, SpeechRecognition, pywhatkit, and requests. It is beginner-friendly, fully voice-controlled, and easy to customize with new commands and contacts.
